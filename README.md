# Expense Splitter

Expense Splitter is a backend-first shared-expenses platform for groups that need to track spending, calculate balances, and settle debts with the fewest possible transfers. It combines a modular Node.js/TypeScript backend, PostgreSQL, Redis, and a lightweight EJS demo UI to deliver a practical full-stack workflow.

## Overview

- Track shared expenses across groups of friends, roommates, or teams
- Compute who owes whom using deterministic balance calculations
- Generate optimized settlement plans with a heap-based matching algorithm
- Provide a minimal browser UI for common user flows
- Expose a documented REST API for frontend and API clients

## Architecture

The application follows a modular monolith design:

- `src/app.ts` configures Express, security middleware, static assets, routes, and error handling
- `src/server.ts` (if present) connects PostgreSQL and Redis before starting the server
- `modules/` contains controller, service, validation, route, and type files for each domain, including auth, users, groups, expenses, and settlements
- `db/` contains the connection layer, schema setup, and seed data
- `frontend/` contains the demo UI, browser-side API calls and assets
- `public/` contains static assets served by Express for the demo UI
- `views/` contains EJS pages for the demo UI

Request flow:

`UI or API client -> Express route -> validation -> controller -> service -> PostgreSQL / Redis -> response`

## Key Capabilities

- JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens and logout support
- User profile management with password change and soft delete
- Group CRUD, membership management, invite links, and role-based access control
- Expense creation with equal, percentage, and custom splits
- Bulk expense import from CSV/TSV-style data
- Settlement planning and execution with idempotency protection
- PDF export for settlement reports
- In-app notifications for invites, expense updates, and settlement reminders
- Redis caching for frequently used group, balance, and settlement data
- Centralized validation and consistent API error handling
- Jest-based unit tests for core service and middleware logic

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 or newer
- PostgreSQL 15 or newer
- Redis 7 or newer

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Configure Environment

- Copy `.env.sample` to `.env`
- Update database, Redis, JWT, and SMTP values
- Use `DB_URL` for PostgreSQL connection string

### Initialize Database

```bash
npm run db:setup
npm run db:seed
```

### Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Production

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

### Tests

```bash
npm test
```

## API Summary

## Demo Pages

- `/login`
- `/dashboard`
- `/groups`
- `/groups/create`
- `/groups/:id`
- `/balances`
- `/history`
- `/settlements`
- `/settlements/:groupId`
- `/notifications`
- `/profile`
- `/join/:token`
- `/reset-password`

## Security

- Passwords are hashed with bcrypt
- Auth uses JWT access and refresh tokens
- Refresh tokens are stored server-side for revocation
- Sensitive routes use authentication middleware
- Group actions enforce role-based access control
- Requests are validated with express-validator
- SQL queries use parameterized statements
- Rate limiting and Helmet reduce common abuse vectors

## Performance and Reliability

- Redis caches group summaries, balances, and settlement plans
- Settlement calculation uses a greedy heap-based algorithm with `O(n log n)` complexity
- Balance calculations ignore tiny floating-point noise with epsilon handling
- Database writes use transactions where needed
- Soft deletes preserve history and avoid destructive loss

## Testing

The current test suite is focused on mocked unit tests:

- Auth service tests
- User service tests
- Group service tests
- Expense service tests
- Import service tests
- Notification service tests
- PDF builder tests
- Middleware tests

Current status:

- 46 passing Jest tests
- 8 passing test suites
- No database writes during test execution

## Documentation

- Project detail: [docs/project-detail.md](docs/project-detail.md)
- Swagger/OpenAPI: [docs/openapi.yaml](docs/openapi.yaml)
- Postman collection: [postman/SplitMate.postman_collection.json](postman/SplitMate.postman_collection.json)

## Known Limitations

- Spreadsheet-native `.xlsx` upload support can still be added later
- Notification delivery is currently in-app plus SMTP when configured
- Frontend is intentionally minimal and focused on demonstrating API flows

## Notes

- The demo UI is designed to be functional rather than feature-complete
- The app is backend-first and API-driven
- The source tree is organized for incremental growth without changing the main stack
